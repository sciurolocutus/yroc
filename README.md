Youthful Ranges of Chaos (roguelike)

Started in 2007 as a pet summer project, it turned into a talking piece for coming up with new ideas, creatively, and implementing them.

Now it will be a good opportunity to refactor, make more SOLID, practice using modern dev tooling, and implement some of the ideas. Then generate more.

This could become a stone soup of ideas.
