Monsters:
N-pede:
Ccccccc or Ppppppp
has a head, and subsequent body portions.
Only head can attack?
When the description is read, it is an N-pede, where
N is the number of segments it has left.
e.g. Ccccc is a pentapede, Ccccccccccc is a hendecapede.
Cr (or Cl or the like) is a sesquipod (1.5ft or 18 inches).

Only the head can direct movement, and, like in Nibbles,
it can't move again if it runs into a trap (head is surrounded by walls or itself).
The AI should try to avoid this.  It does have the option
of standing still, unlike in Nibbles, and running into the wall or itself
doesn't actually kill it.

Like in Centipede, if a non-head section is killed,
the following tail  becomes another N-minus-M-pede (ha)
and the head section is reduced to an M-minus-N-minus-1-pede (ha).
